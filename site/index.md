# Cloud Native Application Design

Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that fully exploits the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. Cloud-native is about how applications are created and deployed, not where. While today public cloud impacts the thinking about infrastructure investment for virtually every industry, a cloud-like delivery model isnâ€™t exclusive to public environments. It's appropriate for both public and private clouds. Most important is the ability to offer nearly limitless computing power, on-demand, along with modern data and application services for developers. When companies build and operate applications in a cloud-native fashion, they bring new ideas to market faster and respond sooner to customer demands.
